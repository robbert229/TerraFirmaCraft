/**
 * This is a manager for capabilities that need to be synced externally, constantly.
 * Most capabilities (Vessel, Mold, Forging, etc.) directly interact with the stack tag, which is synced by vanilla and respects the creative inventory.
 * However, that relies on the capability to be able to detect changes and sync on change.
 * This is <strong>impossible</strong> with {@link HeatCapability} and {@link FoodCapability} as their serialization can change without intervention, so it cannot be saved on modification.
 * <p>
 * A note on why {@link ItemStack#getShareTag()} does not work for this purpose:
 * - It needs to be overriden for items (which means it works for none of our event attached capabilities)
 * - In the cases where we could use it, it's not needed (because we just stick to using the stack tag which should ALWAYS be synced.)
 * - It's still ineffective in the case of the creative inventory.
 * <p>
 * So, in order to solve both problems (S -> C sync, and creative inventory C -> S sync):
 * - We patch the encode item stack to use this method, to sync non-stack-tag capabilities
 * - All other capabilities use the stack tag to avoid sync concerns.
 * <p>
 * Finally, in order to avoid issues caused by other mods due to incorrectly synced item stacks (see <a href="https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft/issues/2198">TerraFirmaCraft#2198</a>), we need to write and read this data in an as unconditional method as possible.
 * This means we cannot check for empty stacks, or those that do not have a capability. In the best case, we write an additional +1 bytes per item stack (a typical item stack has ~4-6 bytes default). This is about as least-cost that we can make it (in the worst case, we write 1 + two nbt tags).
 * <p>
 * We also use a separate capability instance - the {@link HeatCapability#NETWORK_CAPABILITY} and {@link FoodCapability#NETWORK_CAPABILITY}. This is done as to be able to access underlying capability implementations without triggering any initialization which may rely on on-thread resources, such as accessing recipes or recipe caches.
